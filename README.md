# NLTK-Book
Jupyter notebooks for each chapter of the NLTK Book. Code snippets, examples, notes, etc. More will be added as I work through the book.
These notebooks were written entirely in Google Colab, and as such, are designed to run in the cloud. The code is messy and lacks notes in some places where I was attempting to debug or use code not provided in the book.
